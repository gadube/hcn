Highly Composite Number Calculator

Will output whether or not a number is highly composite (has more factors than any number before it).
If the given number is not highly composite then the closest highly composite number less than the entered number will be given.

The goal of this project is to practice programming skills on something fun that can be improved upon in the future.
